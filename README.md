[Exercise 1](https://github.com/utkarshraaz/univ.ai/blob/main/Exercise%20Text%20Classification.ipynb) Refers to basic idea of text classification, which includes juding a review by looking at the positive words or negative words in them. It also includes the pre processing we do with the sentances which contains punctuation signs and uppercase letters. Because of the nature of the data, each review has HTML characters. In order to analyze the information, we have to remove all the special characters and replace upper case words with lower case.
